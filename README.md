A SwiftUI-like framework for creating cross-platform apps in Swift (5.10+).

To dive right in with SwiftCrossUI, check out [the SwiftCrossUI quick start guide](https://stackotter.github.io/swift-cross-ui/documentation/swiftcrossui/quick-start).

> [!NOTE]
> SwiftCrossUI does not attempt to replicate SwiftUI's API perfectly since that would be a constantly-moving target and SwiftUI has many entrenched Apple-centric concepts. That said, SwiftCrossUI's built-in views and scenes share much of their API surface with their SwiftUI cousins, and over time SwiftCrossUI will likely adopt many of SwiftUI's commonly-used APIs.

## Community

Discussion about SwiftCrossUI happens in the [SwiftCrossUI Discord server](https://discord.gg/fw2trT48ny). [Join](https://discord.gg/fw2trT48ny) to discuss the library, get involved, or just be kept up-to-date on progress!

## Supporting SwiftCrossUI

If you find SwiftCrossUI useful, please consider supporting me by [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/stackotter). I spend most of my spare time working on open-source projects, and each sponsorship helps me focus more time on making high quality libraries and tools for the community.

## Documentation

Here's the [documentation site](https://stackotter.github.io/swift-cross-ui/documentation/swiftcrossui). SwiftCrossUI is still a work-in-progress; proper documentation and tutorials are on the horizon. Documentation contributions are very welcome!

## Basic example

Here's a simple example app demonstrating how easy it is to get started with SwiftCrossUI. For a more detailed walkthrough, check out our [quick start guide](https://stackotter.github.io/swift-cross-ui/documentation/swiftcrossui/quick-start)

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "YourApp",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/stackotter/swift-cross-ui", branch: "main")
    ],
    targets: [
        .executableTarget(
            name: "YourApp",
            dependencies: [
                .product(name: "SwiftCrossUI", package: "swift-cross-ui"),
                .product(name: "DefaultBackend", package: "swift-cross-ui"),
            ]
        )
    ]
)
```
Figure 1: *Package.swift*

```swift
import SwiftCrossUI
import DefaultBackend

@main
struct CounterApp: App {
    @State var count = 0

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup("CounterApp") {
            HStack {
                Button("-") { count -= 1 }
                Text("Count: \(count)")
                Button("+") { count += 1 }
            }.padding()
        }
    }
}
```

Clone the SwiftCrossUI repository to test out this example, and many more;

```sh
git clone https://github.com/stackotter/swift-cross-ui
cd swift-cross-ui/Examples
swift run CounterExample
```

The examples are written as Swift packages, which means you can't run them on iOS directly without creating an Xcode project. By using tools like [`mint`](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint) and [`swift-bundler`](https://github.com/stackotter/swift-bundler), running these apps on the iOS Simulator becomes much easier.

```sh
brew install mint
mint install stackotter/swift-bundler@main
git clone https://github.com/stackotter/swift-cross-ui
cd swift-cross-ui/Examples
swift bundler run CounterExample --simulator "iPhone"
```

The documentation contains [a detailed list of all examples](https://stackotter.github.io/swift-cross-ui/documentation/swiftcrossui/examples)

## Backends

SwiftCrossUI has a variety of backends tailored to different operating systems. The beauty of SwiftCrossUI is that you can write your app once and have it look native everywhere. For this reason I recommend using [DefaultBackend](https://stackotter.github.io/swift-cross-ui/documentation/swiftcrossui/defaultbackend) unless you've got particular constraints.

> [!TIP]
> Click through each backend name for detailed system requirements and installation instructions.

- [DefaultBackend](https://stackotter.github.io/swift-cross-ui/documentation/swiftcrossui/defaultbackend): Adapts to your target operating system. On macOS it uses [AppKitBackend](https://stackotter.github.io/swift-cross-ui/documentation/swiftcrossui/appkitbackend), on Windows it uses [WinUIBackend](https://stackotter.github.io/swift-cross-ui/documentation/swiftcrossui/winuibackend), on Linux it uses [GtkBackend](https://stackotter.github.io/swift-cross-ui/documentation/swiftcrossui/gtkbackend), and on iOS and tvOS it uses [UIKitBackend](https://stackotter.github.io/swift-cross-ui/documentation/swiftcrossui/uikitbackend).
- [AppKitBackend](https://stackotter.github.io/swift-cross-ui/documentation/swiftcrossui/appkitbackend): The native macOS backend. Supports all SwiftCrossUI features.
- [UIKitBackend](https://stackotter.github.io/swift-cross-ui/documentation/swiftcrossui/uikitbackend): The native iOS & tvOS backend. Supports most SwiftCrossUI features.
- [WinUIBackend](https://stackotter.github.io/swift-cross-ui/documentation/swiftcrossui/winuibackend): The native Windows backend. Supports most SwiftCrossUI features.
- [GtkBackend](https://stackotter.github.io/swift-cross-ui/documentation/swiftcrossui/gtkbackend): Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Requires gtk 4 to be installed. Supports most SwiftCrossUI features.
- [Gtk3Backend](https://stackotter.github.io/swift-cross-ui/documentation/swiftcrossui/gtk3backend): Exists to target older Linux distributions. Requires gtk 3 to be installed. Supports most SwiftCrossUI features. Quite buggy on macOS due to underlying Gtk 3 bugs.

> [!TIP]
> If you're using DefaultBackend, you can override the underlying backend during compilation by setting the `SCUI_DEFAULT_BACKEND` environment variable to the name of the desired backend. This is useful when you e.g. want to test the Gtk version of your app while using a Mac. Note that this only works for built-in backends and still requires the chosen backend to be compatible with your machine.
