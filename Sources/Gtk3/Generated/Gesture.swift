/// #GtkGesture is the base object for gesture recognition, although this
/// object is quite generalized to serve as a base for multi-touch gestures,
/// it is suitable to implement single-touch and pointer-based gestures (using
/// the special %NULL #GdkEventSequence value for these).
///
/// The number of touches that a #GtkGesture need to be recognized is controlled
/// by the #GtkGesture:n-points property, if a gesture is keeping track of less
/// or more than that number of sequences, it won't check wether the gesture
/// is recognized.
///
/// As soon as the gesture has the expected number of touches, the gesture will
/// run the #GtkGesture::check signal regularly on input events until the gesture
/// is recognized, the criteria to consider a gesture as "recognized" is left to
/// #GtkGesture subclasses.
///
/// A recognized gesture will then emit the following signals:
/// - #GtkGesture::begin when the gesture is recognized.
/// - A number of #GtkGesture::update, whenever an input event is processed.
/// - #GtkGesture::end when the gesture is no longer recognized.
///
/// ## Event propagation
///
/// In order to receive events, a gesture needs to either set a propagation phase
/// through gtk_event_controller_set_propagation_phase(), or feed those manually
/// through gtk_event_controller_handle_event().
///
/// In the capture phase, events are propagated from the toplevel down to the
/// target widget, and gestures that are attached to containers above the widget
/// get a chance to interact with the event before it reaches the target.
///
/// After the capture phase, GTK+ emits the traditional #GtkWidget::button-press-event,
/// #GtkWidget::button-release-event, #GtkWidget::touch-event, etc signals. Gestures
/// with the %GTK_PHASE_TARGET phase are fed events from the default #GtkWidget::event
/// handlers.
///
/// In the bubble phase, events are propagated up from the target widget to the
/// toplevel, and gestures that are attached to containers above the widget get
/// a chance to interact with events that have not been handled yet.
///
/// ## States of a sequence # {#touch-sequence-states}
///
/// Whenever input interaction happens, a single event may trigger a cascade of
/// #GtkGestures, both across the parents of the widget receiving the event and
/// in parallel within an individual widget. It is a responsibility of the
/// widgets using those gestures to set the state of touch sequences accordingly
/// in order to enable cooperation of gestures around the #GdkEventSequences
/// triggering those.
///
/// Within a widget, gestures can be grouped through gtk_gesture_group(),
/// grouped gestures synchronize the state of sequences, so calling
/// gtk_gesture_set_sequence_state() on one will effectively propagate
/// the state throughout the group.
///
/// By default, all sequences start out in the #GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_NONE state,
/// sequences in this state trigger the gesture event handler, but event
/// propagation will continue unstopped by gestures.
///
/// If a sequence enters into the #GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED state, the gesture
/// group will effectively ignore the sequence, letting events go unstopped
/// through the gesture, but the "slot" will still remain occupied while
/// the touch is active.
///
/// If a sequence enters in the #GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_CLAIMED state, the gesture
/// group will grab all interaction on the sequence, by:
/// - Setting the same sequence to #GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED on every other gesture
/// group within the widget, and every gesture on parent widgets in the propagation
/// chain.
/// - calling #GtkGesture::cancel on every gesture in widgets underneath in the
/// propagation chain.
/// - Stopping event propagation after the gesture group handles the event.
///
/// Note: if a sequence is set early to #GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_CLAIMED on
/// #GDK_TOUCH_BEGIN/#GDK_BUTTON_PRESS (so those events are captured before
/// reaching the event widget, this implies #GTK_PHASE_CAPTURE), one similar
/// event will emulated if the sequence changes to #GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED.
/// This way event coherence is preserved before event propagation is unstopped
/// again.
///
/// Sequence states can't be changed freely, see gtk_gesture_set_sequence_state()
/// to know about the possible lifetimes of a #GdkEventSequence.
///
/// ## Touchpad gestures
///
/// On the platforms that support it, #GtkGesture will handle transparently
/// touchpad gesture events. The only precautions users of #GtkGesture should do
/// to enable this support are:
/// - Enabling %GDK_TOUCHPAD_GESTURE_MASK on their #GdkWindows
/// - If the gesture has %GTK_PHASE_NONE, ensuring events of type
/// %GDK_TOUCHPAD_SWIPE and %GDK_TOUCHPAD_PINCH are handled by the #GtkGesture
