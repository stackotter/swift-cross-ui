/// A #GtkMenuShell is the abstract base class used to derive the
/// #GtkMenu and #GtkMenuBar subclasses.
///
/// A #GtkMenuShell is a container of #GtkMenuItem objects arranged
/// in a list which can be navigated, selected, and activated by the
/// user to perform application functions. A #GtkMenuItem can have a
/// submenu associated with it, allowing for nested hierarchical menus.
///
/// # Terminology
///
/// A menu item can be “selected”, this means that it is displayed
/// in the prelight state, and if it has a submenu, that submenu
/// will be popped up.
///
/// A menu is “active” when it is visible onscreen and the user
/// is selecting from it. A menubar is not active until the user
/// clicks on one of its menuitems. When a menu is active,
/// passing the mouse over a submenu will pop it up.
///
/// There is also is a concept of the current menu and a current
/// menu item. The current menu item is the selected menu item
/// that is furthest down in the hierarchy. (Every active menu shell
/// does not necessarily contain a selected menu item, but if
/// it does, then the parent menu shell must also contain
/// a selected menu item.) The current menu is the menu that
/// contains the current menu item. It will always have a GTK
/// grab and receive all key presses.
