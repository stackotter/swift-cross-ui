/// #GtkFileChooserNative is an abstraction of a dialog box suitable
/// for use with “File/Open” or “File/Save as” commands. By default, this
/// just uses a #GtkFileChooserDialog to implement the actual dialog.
/// However, on certain platforms, such as Windows and macOS, the native platform
/// file chooser is used instead. When the application is running in a
/// sandboxed environment without direct filesystem access (such as Flatpak),
/// #GtkFileChooserNative may call the proper APIs (portals) to let the user
/// choose a file and make it available to the application.
/// 
/// While the API of #GtkFileChooserNative closely mirrors #GtkFileChooserDialog, the main
/// difference is that there is no access to any #GtkWindow or #GtkWidget for the dialog.
/// This is required, as there may not be one in the case of a platform native dialog.
/// Showing, hiding and running the dialog is handled by the #GtkNativeDialog functions.
/// 
/// ## Typical usage ## {#gtkfilechoosernative-typical-usage}
/// 
/// In the simplest of cases, you can the following code to use
/// #GtkFileChooserDialog to select a file for opening:
/// 
/// |[
/// GtkFileChooserNative *native;
/// GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN;
/// gint res;
/// 
/// native = gtk_file_chooser_native_new ("Open File",
/// parent_window,
/// action,
/// "_Open",
/// "_Cancel");
/// 
/// res = gtk_native_dialog_run (GTK_NATIVE_DIALOG (native));
/// if (res == GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT)
/// {
/// char *filename;
/// GtkFileChooser *chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (native);
/// filename = gtk_file_chooser_get_filename (chooser);
/// open_file (filename);
/// g_free (filename);
/// }
/// 
/// g_object_unref (native);
/// ]|
/// 
/// To use a dialog for saving, you can use this:
/// 
/// |[
/// GtkFileChooserNative *native;
/// GtkFileChooser *chooser;
/// GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SAVE;
/// gint res;
/// 
/// native = gtk_file_chooser_native_new ("Save File",
/// parent_window,
/// action,
/// "_Save",
/// "_Cancel");
/// chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (native);
/// 
/// gtk_file_chooser_set_do_overwrite_confirmation (chooser, TRUE);
/// 
/// if (user_edited_a_new_document)
/// gtk_file_chooser_set_current_name (chooser,
/// _("Untitled document"));
/// else
/// gtk_file_chooser_set_filename (chooser,
/// existing_filename);
/// 
/// res = gtk_native_dialog_run (GTK_NATIVE_DIALOG (native));
/// if (res == GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT)
/// {
/// char *filename;
/// 
/// filename = gtk_file_chooser_get_filename (chooser);
/// save_to_file (filename);
/// g_free (filename);
/// }
/// 
/// g_object_unref (native);
/// ]|
/// 
/// For more information on how to best set up a file dialog, see #GtkFileChooserDialog.
/// 
/// ## Response Codes ## {#gtkfilechooserdialognative-responses}
/// 
/// #GtkFileChooserNative inherits from #GtkNativeDialog, which means it
/// will return #GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT if the user accepted, and
/// #GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL if he pressed cancel. It can also return
/// #GTK_RESPONSE_DELETE_EVENT if the window was unexpectedly closed.
/// 
/// ## Differences from #GtkFileChooserDialog ##  {#gtkfilechooserdialognative-differences}
/// 
/// There are a few things in the GtkFileChooser API that are not
/// possible to use with #GtkFileChooserNative, as such use would
/// prohibit the use of a native dialog.
/// 
/// There is no support for the signals that are emitted when the user
/// navigates in the dialog, including:
/// * #GtkFileChooser::current-folder-changed
/// * #GtkFileChooser::selection-changed
/// * #GtkFileChooser::file-activated
/// * #GtkFileChooser::confirm-overwrite
/// 
/// You can also not use the methods that directly control user navigation:
/// * gtk_file_chooser_unselect_filename()
/// * gtk_file_chooser_select_all()
/// * gtk_file_chooser_unselect_all()
/// 
/// If you need any of the above you will have to use #GtkFileChooserDialog directly.
/// 
/// No operations that change the the dialog work while the dialog is
/// visible. Set all the properties that are required before showing the dialog.
/// 
/// ## Win32 details ## {#gtkfilechooserdialognative-win32}
/// 
/// On windows the IFileDialog implementation (added in Windows Vista) is
/// used. It supports many of the features that #GtkFileChooserDialog
/// does, but there are some things it does not handle:
/// 
/// * Extra widgets added with gtk_file_chooser_set_extra_widget().
/// 
/// * Use of custom previews by connecting to #GtkFileChooser::update-preview.
/// 
/// * Any #GtkFileFilter added using a mimetype or custom filter.
/// 
/// If any of these features are used the regular #GtkFileChooserDialog
/// will be used in place of the native one.
/// 
/// ## Portal details ## {#gtkfilechooserdialognative-portal}
/// 
/// When the org.freedesktop.portal.FileChooser portal is available on the
/// session bus, it is used to bring up an out-of-process file chooser. Depending
/// on the kind of session the application is running in, this may or may not
/// be a GTK+ file chooser. In this situation, the following things are not
/// supported and will be silently ignored:
/// 
/// * Extra widgets added with gtk_file_chooser_set_extra_widget().
/// 
/// * Use of custom previews by connecting to #GtkFileChooser::update-preview.
/// 
/// * Any #GtkFileFilter added with a custom filter.
/// 
/// ## macOS details ## {#gtkfilechooserdialognative-macos}
/// 
/// On macOS the NSSavePanel and NSOpenPanel classes are used to provide native
/// file chooser dialogs. Some features provided by #GtkFileChooserDialog are
/// not supported:
/// 
/// * Extra widgets added with gtk_file_chooser_set_extra_widget(), unless the
/// widget is an instance of GtkLabel, in which case the label text will be used
/// to set the NSSavePanel message instance property.
/// 
/// * Use of custom previews by connecting to #GtkFileChooser::update-preview.
/// 
/// * Any #GtkFileFilter added with a custom filter.
/// 
/// * Shortcut folders.
