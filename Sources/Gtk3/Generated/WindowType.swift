/// gtk_window_set_decorated() to toggle the frame).  Windows with type
/// #GTK_WINDOW_POPUP are ignored by the window manager; window manager
/// keybindings won’t work on them, the window manager won’t decorate the
/// window with a frame, many GTK+ features that rely on the window
/// manager will not work (e.g. resize grips and
/// maximization/minimization). #GTK_WINDOW_POPUP is used to implement
/// widgets such as #GtkMenu or tooltips that you normally don’t think of
/// as windows per se. Nearly all windows should be #GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL.
/// In particular, do not use #GTK_WINDOW_POPUP just to turn off
/// the window borders; use gtk_window_set_decorated() for that.
