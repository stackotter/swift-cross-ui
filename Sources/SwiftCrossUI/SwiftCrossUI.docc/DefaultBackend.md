# DefaultBackend

An adaptive backend which uses different backends under the hood depending on the target operating system.

## Overview

The beauty of SwiftCrossUI is that you can write your app once and have it look native everywhere. For this reason I recommend using DefaultBackend unless you've got particular constraints. It uses <doc:AppKitBackend> on macOS, <doc:WinUIBackend> on Window, <doc:GtkBackend> on Linux, and on <doc:UIKitBackend> on iOS/tvOS.

> Tip: If you're using DefaultBackend, you can override the underlying backend during compilation by setting the `SCUI_DEFAULT_BACKEND` environment variable to the name of the desired backend. This is useful when you e.g. want to test the Gtk version of your app while using a Mac. Note that this only works for built-in backends and still requires the chosen backend to be compatible with your machine.

> Warning: When using `SCUI_DEFAULT_BACKEND` to switch underlying backends, you may encounter some linker-related missing symbol errors. These are caused by a SwiftPM bug and usually disappear if you run `swift package clean` before attempting to build your app again.

## Usage

```swift
...

let package = Package(
  ...
  targets: [
    ...
    .executableTarget(
      name: "YourApp",
      dependencies: [
        .product(name: "SwiftCrossUI", package: "swift-cross-ui"),
        .product(name: "DefaultBackend", package: "swift-cross-ui"),
      ]
    )
    ...
  ]
  ...
)
```
Figure 1: *adding `DefaultBackend` to an executable target*

```swift
import SwiftCrossUI
import DefaultBackend

@main
struct YourApp: App {
  // You can explicitly initialize your app's chosen backend if you desire.
  // This happens automatically when you import any of the built-in backends.
  //
  // var backend = DefaultBackend()

  var body: some Scene {
    WindowGroup {
      Text("Hello, World!")
        .padding()
    }
  }
}
```
