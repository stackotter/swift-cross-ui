# View fundamentals

## Overview

The ``View`` protocol and the ``ViewBuilder`` result builder are the backbone of SwiftCrossUI. Together they enable you to build up large apps from simple views.

The main two view composition primitives are ``VStack``, for vertical layouts, and ``HStack``, for horizontal layouts. ``ZStack`` comes in handy sometimes when you need to overlay a bunch of views in the z direction.
