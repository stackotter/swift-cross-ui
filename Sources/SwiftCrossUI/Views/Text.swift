/// A view the displays text.
///
/// ``Text`` truncates its content to fit within its proposed size. To wrap
/// without truncation, put the ``Text`` (or its enclosing view hierarchy) into
/// an ideal height context such as a ``ScrollView``. Alternatively, use
/// ``View/fixedSize(horizontal:vertical:)`` with `horizontal` set to false and
/// `vertical` set to true, but be aware that this may lead to unintuitive
/// minimum sizing behaviour when used within a window. Often when developers
/// use ``View/fixedSize()`` on text, what they really need is a ``ScrollView``.
///
/// To avoid wrapping and truncation entirely, use ``View/fixedSize()``.
///
/// ## Technical notes
///
/// The reason that ``Text`` truncates its content to fit its proposed size is
/// that SwiftCrossUI's layout system behaves rather unintuitively with views
/// that trade off width for height. The layout system used to support this
/// behaviour well, but when overhauling the layout system with performance in
/// mind, we discovered that it's not possible to handle minimum view sizing in
/// the intuitive way that we were, without a large performance cost or layout
/// system complexity cost.
///
/// With the current system, windows determine the minimum size of their content
/// by proposing a size of 0x0. A text view that doesn't truncate its content
/// would take on a width of 0 and then lay out each character on a new line (as
/// that's what most UI frameworks do when text is given a small width). This
/// leads to the window thinking that its minimum height is
/// `characterCount * lineHeight`, even though when given a width larger than
/// zero, the text view would be shorter than this 'minimum height'. The
/// underlying cause is the assumption that 'minimum size' is a sensible notion
/// for every view. A text view without truncation doesn't have a
/// 'minimum size'; are we minimizing width? height? width + height? area?
///
/// SwiftCrossUI's old layout system separated the concept of minimum size into
/// 'minimum width for current height', and 'minimum height for current width'.
/// This led to much more intuitive window sizing behaviour. If you had
/// non-truncating text inside a window, and resized the width of the window
/// such that the height of the text became taller than the window, then the
/// window would become taller, and if you resized the height of the window then
/// you'd reach the window's minimum height before the text could overflow the
/// window horizontally. Unfortunately this required a lot of book-keeping, and
/// was deemed to be unfeasible to do without significantly hurting performance
/// due to all the layout assumptions that we'd have to drop from our stack
/// layout algorithm.
///
/// The new layout system behaviour is in line with SwiftUI's layout behaviour.
