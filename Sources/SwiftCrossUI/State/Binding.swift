/// A value that can read and write a different value owned by a source of
/// truth.
///
/// You can create a binding in several different ways:
/// - by accessing the ``projectedValue`` (via leading `$` syntax) on a piece of
///   ``State`` or another `Binding`
/// - by _projecting_ a property of an existing binding with dynamic member
///   lookup (``subscript(dynamicMember:)``)
/// - by calling ``init(get:set:)`` with a custom getter and setter
///
/// That last one reveals something important about bindings: while they can be
/// thought of as writable references to their sources of truth, in reality
/// they're nothing more than getter-setter pairs. A binding can have any
/// arbitrary getter and setter, and the two functions don't even have to be
/// related. However, SwiftCrossUI's reactivity relies on a binding's getter and
/// setter consistently managing the same source of truth; see
/// ``init(get:set:)`` for more info.
