/// An object that can be observed for changes.
///
/// The default implementation only publishes changes made to properties that
/// have been wrapped with the ``Published`` property wrapper. Even properties
/// that themselves conform to ``ObservableObject`` must be wrapped with the
/// ``Published`` property wrapper for clarity.
///
/// ```swift
/// class NestedState: ObservableObject {
///     // Both `startIndex` and `endIndex` will have their changes published to `NestedState`'s
///     // `didChange` publisher.
///     @Published
///     var startIndex = 0
///
///     @Published
///     var endIndex = 0
/// }
///
/// class CounterState: ObservableObject {
///     // Only changes to `count` will be published (it is the only property with `@Published`)
///     @Published
///     var count = 0
///
///     var otherCount = 0
///
///     // Even though `nested` is `ObservableObject`, its changes won't be
///     // published because if you could have observed properties without
///     // `@Published` things would get pretty messy and you'd always have to
///     // check the definition of the type of each property to know exactly
///     // what would and wouldn't cause updates.
///     var nested = NestedState()
/// }
/// ```
///
/// To use an observable object as part of a view's state, use the ``State`` property
/// wrapper. It'll detect that it's been given an observable and will forward any
/// observations published by the object's ``ObservableObject/didChange`` publisher.
///
/// ```swift
/// class CounterState: ObservableObject {
///     @Published var count = 0
/// }
///
/// struct CounterView: View {
///     @State var state = CounterState()
///
///     var body: some View {
///         HStack {
///             Button("-") {
///                 state.count -= 1
///             }
///             Text("Count: \(state.count)")
///             Button("+") {
///                 state.count += 1
///             }
///         }
///     }
/// }
