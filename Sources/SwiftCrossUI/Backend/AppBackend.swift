import Foundation

/// A backend that can be used to run an app. Usually built on top of an
/// existing UI framework.
///
/// Default placeholder implementations are available for all non-essential
/// app lifecycle methods. These implementations will fatally crash when called
/// and are simply intended to allow incremental implementation of backends,
/// not a production-ready fallback for views that cannot be represented by a
/// given backend. The methods you need to implemented up-front (which don't
/// have default implementations) are: ``AppBackend/createRootWindow(withDefaultSize:_:)``,
/// ``AppBackend/setTitle(ofWindow:to:)``, ``AppBackend/setResizability(ofWindow:to:)``,
/// ``AppBackend/setChild(ofWindow:to:)``, ``AppBackend/show(window:)``,
/// ``AppBackend/runMainLoop()``, ``AppBackend/runInMainThread(action:)``,
/// ``AppBackend/isWindowProgrammaticallyResizable(_:)``,
/// ``AppBackend/show(widget:)``.
/// Many of these can simply be given dummy implementations until you're ready
/// to implement them properly.
///
/// If you need to modify the children of a widget after creation but there
/// aren't update methods available, this is an intentional limitation to
/// reduce the complexity of maintaining a multitude of backends -- nest
/// another container, such as a VStack, inside the container to allow you
/// to change its children on demand.
///
/// For interactive controls with values, the method for setting the
/// control's value is always separate from the method for updating the
/// control's properties (e.g. its minimum value, or placeholder label etc).
/// This is because it's very common for view implementations to either
/// update a control's properties without updating its value (in the case
/// of an unbound control), or update a control's value only if it doesn't
/// match its current value (to prevent infinite loops).
///
/// Many views have both a `create` and an `update` method. The `create`
/// method should only have parameters for properties which don't have
/// sensible defaults (e.g. under some backends, image widgets can't be
/// created without an underlying image being selected up-front, so the
/// `create` method requires a `filePath` and will overlap with the `update`
/// method). This design choice was made to reduce the amount of repeated
/// code between the `create` and `update` methods of the various widgets
/// (since the `update` method is always called between calling `create`
/// and actually displaying the widget anyway).
