/// Base class for platform dialogs that don't use `GtkDialog`.
///
/// Native dialogs are used in order to integrate better with a platform,
/// by looking the same as other native applications and supporting
/// platform specific features.
///
/// The [class@Gtk.Dialog] functions cannot be used on such objects,
/// but we need a similar API in order to drive them. The `GtkNativeDialog`
/// object is an API that allows you to do this. It allows you to set
/// various common properties on the dialog, as well as show and hide
/// it and get a [signal@Gtk.NativeDialog::response] signal when the user
/// finished with the dialog.
///
/// Note that unlike `GtkDialog`, `GtkNativeDialog` objects are not
/// toplevel widgets, and GTK does not keep them alive. It is your
/// responsibility to keep a reference until you are done with the
/// object.
