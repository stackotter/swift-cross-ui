/// `GtkAppChooser` is an interface for widgets which allow the user to

/// [class@Gtk.AppChooserDialog] and [class@Gtk.AppChooserButton].
///
/// Applications are represented by GIO `GAppInfo` objects here.
/// GIO has a concept of recommended and fallback applications for a
/// given content type. Recommended applications are those that claim
/// to handle the content type itself, while fallback also includes
/// applications that handle a more generic content type. GIO also
/// knows the default and last-used application for a given content
/// type. The `GtkAppChooserWidget` provides detailed control over
/// whether the shown list of applications should include default,
/// recommended or fallback applications.
///
/// To obtain the application that has been selected in a `GtkAppChooser`,
/// use [method@Gtk.AppChooser.get_app_info].
