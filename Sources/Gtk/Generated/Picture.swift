///
/// Many convenience functions are provided to make pictures simple to use.
/// For example, if you want to load an image from a file, and then display
/// it, there’s a convenience function to do this:
///
/// ```c
/// GtkWidget *widget = gtk_picture_new_for_filename ("myfile.png");
/// ```
///
/// If the file isn’t loaded successfully, the picture will contain a
/// “broken image” icon similar to that used in many web browsers.
/// If you want to handle errors in loading the file yourself,
/// for example by displaying an error message, then load the image with
/// and image loading framework such as libglycin, then create the `GtkPicture`
/// with [ctor@Gtk.Picture.new_for_paintable].
///
/// Sometimes an application will want to avoid depending on external data
/// files, such as image files. See the documentation of `GResource` for details.
/// In this case, [ctor@Gtk.Picture.new_for_resource] and
/// [method@Gtk.Picture.set_resource] should be used.
///
/// `GtkPicture` displays an image at its natural size. See [class@Gtk.Image]
/// if you want to display a fixed-size image, such as an icon.
///
/// ## Sizing the paintable
///
/// You can influence how the paintable is displayed inside the `GtkPicture`
/// by changing [property@Gtk.Picture:content-fit]. See [enum@Gtk.ContentFit]
/// for details. [property@Gtk.Picture:can-shrink] can be unset to make sure
/// that paintables are never made smaller than their ideal size - but
/// be careful if you do not know the size of the paintable in use (like
/// when displaying user-loaded images). This can easily cause the picture to
/// grow larger than the screen. And [property@Gtk.Widget:halign] and
/// [property@Gtk.Widget:valign] can be used to make sure the paintable doesn't
/// fill all available space but is instead displayed at its original size.
///
/// ## CSS nodes
///
/// `GtkPicture` has a single CSS node with the name `picture`.
///
/// ## Accessibility
///
/// `GtkPicture` uses the [enum@Gtk.AccessibleRole.img] role.
