/// ![An example GtkSwitch](switch.png)

/// The user can control which state should be active by clicking the
/// empty area, or by dragging the slider.
///
/// `GtkSwitch` can also express situations where the underlying state changes
/// with a delay. In this case, the slider position indicates the user's recent
/// change (represented by the [property@Gtk.Switch:active] property), while the
/// trough color indicates the present underlying state (represented by the
/// [property@Gtk.Switch:state] property).
