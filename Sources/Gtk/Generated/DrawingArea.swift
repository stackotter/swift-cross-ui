/// It’s essentially a blank widget; you can draw on it. After
/// creating a drawing area, the application may want to connect to:
///
/// - The [signal@Gtk.Widget::realize] signal to take any necessary actions
/// when the widget is instantiated on a particular display.
/// (Create GDK resources in response to this signal.)
///
/// - The [signal@Gtk.DrawingArea::resize] signal to take any necessary
/// actions when the widget changes size.
///
/// - Call [method@Gtk.DrawingArea.set_draw_func] to handle redrawing the
/// contents of the widget.
///
/// The following code portion demonstrates using a drawing
/// area to display a circle in the normal widget foreground
/// color.
///
/// ## Simple GtkDrawingArea usage
///
/// ```c
/// static void
/// draw_function (GtkDrawingArea *area,
/// cairo_t        *cr,
/// int             width,
/// int             height,
/// gpointer        data)
/// {
/// GdkRGBA color;
///
/// cairo_arc (cr,
/// width / 2.0, height / 2.0,
/// MIN (width, height) / 2.0,
/// 0, 2 * G_PI);
///
/// gtk_widget_get_color (GTK_WIDGET (area),
/// &color);
/// gdk_cairo_set_source_rgba (cr, &color);
///
/// cairo_fill (cr);
/// }
///
/// int
/// main (int argc, char **argv)
/// {
/// gtk_init ();
///
/// GtkWidget *area = gtk_drawing_area_new ();
/// gtk_drawing_area_set_content_width (GTK_DRAWING_AREA (area), 100);
/// gtk_drawing_area_set_content_height (GTK_DRAWING_AREA (area), 100);
/// gtk_drawing_area_set_draw_func (GTK_DRAWING_AREA (area),
/// draw_function,
/// NULL, NULL);
/// return 0;
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The draw function is normally called when a drawing area first comes
/// onscreen, or when it’s covered by another window and then uncovered.
/// You can also force a redraw by adding to the “damage region” of the
/// drawing area’s window using [method@Gtk.Widget.queue_draw].
/// This will cause the drawing area to call the draw function again.
///
/// The available routines for drawing are documented in the
/// [Cairo documentation](https://www.cairographics.org/manual/); GDK
/// offers additional API to integrate with Cairo, like [func@Gdk.cairo_set_source_rgba]
/// or [func@Gdk.cairo_set_source_pixbuf].
///
/// To receive mouse events on a drawing area, you will need to use
/// event controllers. To receive keyboard events, you will need to set
/// the “can-focus” property on the drawing area, and you should probably
/// draw some user-visible indication that the drawing area is focused.
///
/// If you need more complex control over your widget, you should consider
/// creating your own `GtkWidget` subclass.
