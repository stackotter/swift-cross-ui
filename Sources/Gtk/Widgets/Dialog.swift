/// Dialogs are a convenient way to prompt the user for a small amount
/// of input.
///
/// ![An example GtkDialog](dialog.png)
///
/// Typical uses are to display a message, ask a question, or anything else
/// that does not require extensive effort on the user’s part.
///
/// The main area of a `GtkDialog` is called the "content area", and is yours
/// to populate with widgets such a `GtkLabel` or `GtkEntry`, to present
/// your information, questions, or tasks to the user.
///
/// In addition, dialogs allow you to add "action widgets". Most commonly,
/// action widgets are buttons. Depending on the platform, action widgets may
/// be presented in the header bar at the top of the window, or at the bottom
/// of the window. To add action widgets, create your `GtkDialog` using
/// [ctor@Gtk.Dialog.new_with_buttons], or use
/// [method@Gtk.Dialog.add_button], [method@Gtk.Dialog.add_buttons],
/// or [method@Gtk.Dialog.add_action_widget].
///
/// `GtkDialogs` uses some heuristics to decide whether to add a close
/// button to the window decorations. If any of the action buttons use
/// the response ID %GTK_RESPONSE_CLOSE or %GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL, the
/// close button is omitted.
///
/// Clicking a button that was added as an action widget will emit the
/// [signal@Gtk.Dialog::response] signal with a response ID that you specified.
/// GTK will never assign a meaning to positive response IDs; these are
/// entirely user-defined. But for convenience, you can use the response
/// IDs in the [enum@Gtk.ResponseType] enumeration (these all have values
/// less than zero). If a dialog receives a delete event, the
/// [signal@Gtk.Dialog::response] signal will be emitted with the
/// %GTK_RESPONSE_DELETE_EVENT response ID.
///
/// Dialogs are created with a call to [ctor@Gtk.Dialog.new] or
/// [ctor@Gtk.Dialog.new_with_buttons]. The latter is recommended; it allows
/// you to set the dialog title, some convenient flags, and add buttons.
///
/// A “modal” dialog (that is, one which freezes the rest of the application
/// from user input), can be created by calling [method@Gtk.Window.set_modal]
/// on the dialog. When using [ctor@Gtk.Dialog.new_with_buttons], you can also
/// pass the %GTK_DIALOG_MODAL flag to make a dialog modal.
///
/// For the simple dialog in the following example, a [class@Gtk.MessageDialog]
/// would save some effort. But you’d need to create the dialog contents manually
/// if you had more than a simple message in the dialog.
///
/// An example for simple `GtkDialog` usage:
///
/// ```c
/// // Function to open a dialog box with a message
/// void
/// quick_message (GtkWindow *parent, char *message)
/// {
/// GtkWidget *dialog, *label, *content_area;
/// GtkDialogFlags flags;
///
/// // Create the widgets
/// flags = GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT;
/// dialog = gtk_dialog_new_with_buttons ("Message",
/// parent,
/// flags,
/// _("_OK"),
/// GTK_RESPONSE_NONE,
/// NULL);
/// content_area = gtk_dialog_get_content_area (GTK_DIALOG (dialog));
/// label = gtk_label_new (message);
///
/// // Ensure that the dialog box is destroyed when the user responds
///
/// g_signal_connect_swapped (dialog,
/// "response",
/// G_CALLBACK (gtk_window_destroy),
/// dialog);
///
/// // Add the label, and show everything we’ve added
///
/// gtk_box_append (GTK_BOX (content_area), label);
/// gtk_widget_show (dialog);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # GtkDialog as GtkBuildable
///
/// The `GtkDialog` implementation of the `GtkBuildable` interface exposes the
/// @content_area as an internal child with the name “content_area”.
///
/// `GtkDialog` supports a custom `<action-widgets>` element, which can contain
/// multiple `<action-widget>` elements. The “response” attribute specifies a
/// numeric response, and the content of the element is the id of widget
/// (which should be a child of the dialogs @action_area). To mark a response
/// as default, set the “default” attribute of the `<action-widget>` element
/// to true.
///
/// `GtkDialog` supports adding action widgets by specifying “action” as
/// the “type” attribute of a `<child>` element. The widget will be added
/// either to the action area or the headerbar of the dialog, depending
/// on the “use-header-bar” property. The response id has to be associated
/// with the action widget using the `<action-widgets>` element.
///
/// An example of a `GtkDialog` UI definition fragment:
///
/// ```xml
/// <object class="GtkDialog" id="dialog1"><child type="action"><object class="GtkButton" id="button_cancel"/></child><child type="action"><object class="GtkButton" id="button_ok"></object></child><action-widgets><action-widget response="cancel">button_cancel</action-widget><action-widget response="ok" default="true">button_ok</action-widget></action-widgets></object>
/// ```
///
/// # Accessibility
///
/// `GtkDialog` uses the %GTK_ACCESSIBLE_ROLE_DIALOG role.
open class Dialog: Window {
    /// Creates a new dialog box.
    ///
    /// Widgets should not be packed into the `GtkWindow`
    /// directly, but into the @content_area and @action_area,
    /// as described above.
